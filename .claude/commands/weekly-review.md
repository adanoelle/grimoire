description: Sunday weekly review with comprehensive stats
---

Run the weekly progress report to see this week's accomplishments.

Execute `./scripts/weekly-report.sh` and show:
1. Total commits this week (DSA vs Systems breakdown)
2. All work completed
3. Topics covered
4. Assessment vs weekly targets:
   - DSA: 10-15 commits (20-30 problems)
   - Systems: 4-6 commits
   - Total: 14-21 commits
   - Days active: 6-7 days

Then help me reflect on the week and plan adjustments for next week.
