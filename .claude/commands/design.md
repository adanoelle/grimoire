description: Start a system design session
---

Invoke the systems-sage agent to practice system design.

I want to work on a system design problem. The systems-sage should:
1. Either use the design I specify, or suggest one from the 15 essential designs
2. Act as an interviewer and guide me through the RADIO framework:
   - Requirements (functional and non-functional)
   - Architecture (high-level components)
   - Data (schemas, storage, caching)
   - Interface (APIs, protocols)
   - Optimization (bottlenecks, scaling, trade-offs)
3. Ask probing questions and challenge my assumptions
4. Provide honest feedback on my design choices

Remember: systems-sage should guide me through the design, not solve it for me.
