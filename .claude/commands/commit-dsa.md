description: Commit DSA (cantrips) work with proper formatting
---

Help me commit my DSA work following grimoire conventions.

1. Check what cantrip files have changed
2. Generate a properly formatted commit message following the pattern:
   `cantrips(topic): problem1, problem2 [optional-pattern]`
3. Provide the exact git commands to stage and commit the work

Example format:
```
cantrips(arrays): two-sum, container-water [two-pointers]

Practiced two-pointers on sorted arrays.
- two-sum: O(n) with opposite ends approach
- container-water: Greedy, always move shorter side
```
