# Hashing

## Overview

Hashing enables O(1) average-case lookups, making it essential for problems involving
counting, frequency analysis, and finding duplicates or complements.

## Core Concepts

### Concept 1: Hash Maps (Dictionaries)

**What it is**: Key-value storage with O(1) average lookup **When to use**: Counting,
caching, two-element lookups **Time complexity**: O(1) average, O(n) worst

### Concept 2: Hash Sets

**What it is**: Collection of unique elements with O(1) membership testing **When to
use**: Checking existence, finding duplicates **Time complexity**: O(1) average

### Concept 3: Frequency Counting

**What it is**: Using hash map to track occurrence counts **When to use**: "Most
frequent", "first unique", character counting **Time complexity**: O(n)

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Complement Pattern

**Recognition**: Two Sum, pair problems **Approach**: Store seen elements, check for
complement **Example problems**: Two Sum, Two Sum variations

### Pattern 2: Counting with HashMap

**Recognition**: "Count occurrences", "frequency" **Approach**: Build frequency map,
then process **Example problems**: First unique character

### Pattern 3: HashSet for Duplicates

**Recognition**: "Find duplicate", "contains duplicate" **Approach**: Add to set,
check if already present **Example problems**: Contains Duplicate
