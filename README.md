# Grimoire

A grimoire of data structures and algorithms for interview preparation

## Recommended flow:

1. Open grimoire in Claude Code
2. Say: "Start my study session"
3. session-starter reviews progress, helps set goals (< 10 min)
4. Work independently - invoke study-partner when stuck
5. End: Commit work, update READMEs
